# FLORIS Wake Modeling & Wind Farm Controls

FLORIS is a controls-focused wind farm simulation software incorporating
steady-state engineering wake models into a performance-focused Python
framework.

The software is in active development and engagement with the development team
is highly encouraged. If you are interested in using FLORIS to conduct studies
of a wind farm or extending FLORIS to include your own wake model, please join
the conversation in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/NREL/floris/discussions/categories/v3-design-discussion)!

Since FLORIS v3, the documentation is migrating to https://nrel.github.io/floris,
but this is a work in progress. For context and background on previous work in
FLORIS, see the legacy documentation at http://floris.readthedocs.io/.

## Quick Start

FLORIS is distributed via `pip`, and can be installed with the following command:

```bash
pip install floris
```








## Getting Started

A series of examples is included in the [examples/](https://github.com/NREL/floris/tree/main/examples)
directory. These are ordered from simplest to most complex. They demonstrate various
use cases of FLORIS, and generally provide a good starting point for building a more
complex simulation.


## Engaging on GitHub

FLORIS leverages the following features of GitHub to coordinate support and development efforts:

- [Discussions](https://github.com/NREL/floris/discussions): Collaborate to develop ideas for new use cases, features, and software designs, and get support for usage questions
- [Issues](https://github.com/NREL/floris/issues): Report potential bugs and well-developed feature requests
- [Projects](https://github.com/orgs/NREL/projects/18/): Include current and future work on a timeline and assign a person to "own" it

Generally, the first entry point for the community will be within one of the
categories in Discussions.
[Ideas](https://github.com/NREL/floris/discussions/categories/ideas) is a great spot to develop the
details for a feature request. [Q&A](https://github.com/NREL/floris/discussions/categories/q-a)
is where to get usage support.
[Show and tell](https://github.com/NREL/floris/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) is a free-form
space to show off the things you are doing with FLORIS.
